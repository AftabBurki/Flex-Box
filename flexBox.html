                <p>

                    Quaid-i-Azam University (once named Islamabad University) was established in July 1967 under the Act
                    of National Assembly and started teaching and research programmes for PhD and MPhil degrees. It was,
                    however, gradually and later decided to offer Master's, graduate, and now undergraduate programmes.
                    The University, for its international repute, faculty and programmes attracts a large number of
                    foreign students although it offers admission to a measured number of students from all regions of
                    the country as it is a federal public sector university.
